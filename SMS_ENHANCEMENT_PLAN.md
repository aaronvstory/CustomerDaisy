# SMS Enhancement Plan - Multiple Code Detection

## Current Issues Identified ‚úÖ

### 1. SMS Code Caching Problem - FIXED
- **Issue**: App only returned first SMS code, ignored subsequent codes
- **Root Cause**: Verification status 'completed' prevented new code detection
- **Solution**: Enhanced caching logic to distinguish manual checks vs polling
- **Result**: Multiple SMS codes now properly detected

### 2. UI Border Alignment - FIXED  
- **Issue**: Misaligned right border in "Same SMS Code" panel
- **Root Cause**: Missing space after ‚ÑπÔ∏è emoji
- **Solution**: Added proper spacing (two spaces after emoji)
- **Result**: Clean, aligned UI borders
