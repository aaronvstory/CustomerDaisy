**Status:** 🟢 FULLY OPERATIONAL

---

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ❌ Field Mapping Error (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** `CustomerRecord.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'email_password'`
- **Root Cause:** Mail manager returned `email_password` field but CustomerRecord expected `password` field
- **Fix:** Enhanced `save_customer` method to map `email_password` → `password` with comprehensive field filtering
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Customer creation now works without field mapping errors

### 2. ❌ Empty Address Generation (RESOLVED) 
**Issue:** Addresses showing empty streets like ", Philadelphia, PA"
- **Root Cause:** MapQuest fallback method returning geocoded addresses with empty street fields
- **Fix:** 
  - Fixed `_get_fallback_address` method with realistic street address generation
  - Added random street name selection (Main St, Oak Ave, Park Rd, etc.)
  - Enhanced address component validation and fallback logic
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - All addresses now have complete street information

### 3. ❌ Missing Email Field in Database Generation (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** `generate_customer_data()` missing required email field
- **Root Cause:** Database generation method didn't include email creation when called standalone
- **Fix:** Added email generation using faker with format: `firstnamelastname1234@domain.com`
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - All required fields now properly generated

### 4. ❌ SMS Verification Spinner Visibility (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** SMS verification lacked live feedback and wasn't prominent enough
- **Root Cause:** Basic verification method without live updates
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented live spinner using Rich's `Live` component with 2 Hz refresh rate
  - Added real-time status display with elapsed time and attempt counters
  - Multiple SMS code support with timestamps
  - Interactive prompts and graceful Ctrl+C handling
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Clear visual indication that app is actively checking for SMS codes

### 5. ❌ UI Styling Issues (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Ugly Rich tables instead of beautiful banners
- **Root Cause:** Application used basic table display throughout
- **Fix:**
  - Created `_create_info_banner` and `_create_status_banner` methods
  - Enhanced DaisySMS status display with elegant banners
  - Improved customer database display with health indicators
  - Added proper spacing and consistent styling throughout
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - Beautiful banner styling throughout application
