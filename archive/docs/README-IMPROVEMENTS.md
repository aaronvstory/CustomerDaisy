# 🌸 CustomerDaisy Interface Improvements

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ✅ **Questionary Arrow-Key Navigation**
- **Issue**: Missing `questionary` dependency caused fallback to numbered menus
- **Fix**: Added `questionary>=2.0.0` to `pyproject.toml` and ran `uv sync`
- **Result**: Beautiful arrow-key navigation throughout the entire application

### ✅ **Consistent Interface Across All Menus**
- **Main Menu**: Arrow-key navigation with emojis
- **SMS Verification Options**: Converted to questionary with clear choices
- **Address Management**: Full questionary interface with descriptive options  
- **Configuration Settings**: Modern arrow-key navigation for all settings
- **Address Selection**: Enhanced selection with recent address support

### ✅ **Clean Visual Formatting** 
- **Banner Cleanup**: Removed redundant banners and excessive spacing
- **Compact Panels**: Standardized 80-character width with minimal padding
- **Reduced Verbosity**: Simplified initialization messages and step descriptions
- **Consistent Spacing**: Clean, readable layout without visual clutter

### ✅ **Intelligent Fallbacks**
- **Terminal Detection**: Automatic detection of interactive vs non-interactive terminals
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to Rich-based menus when questionary unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Smart fallbacks for different environments and error conditions

## 🚀 How to Experience the Improvements

### **Option 1: Test Arrow-Key Interface**
```batch
test-questionary.bat
```
This will test if questionary arrow-key navigation works in your environment.

### **Option 2: Launch the Application**
```batch
launch.bat
```
The application will automatically:
- Use arrow-key navigation in interactive terminals
- Fall back to numbered menus in non-interactive environments
- Display appropriate instructions for each mode

## 🎯 Expected User Experience
